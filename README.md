js-beginners-day1
=================

Curriculum for the first day of the OpenTechSchool workshop "JavaScript for absolute beginners".

**Caution:** There's also a variant of this material here: https://github.com/OpenTechSchool/js-beginners-4h-workshop-1. This one is a bit shorter and easier and has been preferred in the last few workshop events.
