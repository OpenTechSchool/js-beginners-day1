<h1>Curriculum: page 3, data</h1>

<p>Inside the computer's world, there is only data. That which is not
data, does not exist. Programs are data. Programs create new data.
It's like some kind of strange, silicon-based cycle of life.</p>


<h2 class=step>Collections</h2>

<h3 class=goal>Goal</h3>

<p>Learn how to group a set of values into a single collection, and
use that collection.</p>

<p>Problem statement: draw a rainbow by drawing seven concentric
circles with the following colors: <em>red, orange, yellow, green,
cyan, purple, white</em>, each smaller than the last.</p>

<h3 class=inst>Instructions</h3>

<p>This is the naive approach:</p>

<pre>function rainbow(x, y) {
  color("red");
  circle(x, y, 150);
  color("orange");
  circle(x, y, 145);
  color("yellow");
  circle(x, y, 140);
  color("green");
  circle(x, y, 135);
  color("cyan");
  circle(x, y, 130);
  color("purple");
  circle(x, y, 125);
  color("white");
  circle(x, y, 120);
}</pre>

<p>That is not wrong, but it is not right either. It repeats itself a
lot. Here is <a href="sandbox/#rainbow.js">a better version</a>:</p>

<pre>function rainbow(x, y) {
  var colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "cyan", "purple", "white"];
  var count = 0;
  while (count < colors.length) {
    color(colors[count]);
    circle(x, y, 150 - 5 * count);
    count = count + 1;
  }
}</pre>

<h3 class=ex>Explanation</h3>

<p>The thing with the square brackets (<strong>[</strong>
and <strong>]</strong>) is called an array. An array is a value that
holds other values—in this case, it holds seven strings that name
colors.</p>

<p>The values in an array are ordered, and each element has a
position. Array positions start at zero, so in the above
example, <code>"red"</code> has position zero,
and <code>"white"</code> (the seventh element) has position 6. The
notation <code>colors[1]</code> is used to access the values in an
array—in this case, it'd produce <code>"orange"</code>.</p>

<p>Another new notation, though we've seen it before
in <code>Math.random</code> is the dot in <code>colors.length</code>.
It is used to fetch another kind of sub-value, called property, out of
a value. In the case of <code>Math.random</code>, it is just used for
grouping—a whole bunch of number-related functions are available as
properties of <code>Math</code> (for example <code>Math.round</code>
to round numbers). But in the case of <code>colors.length</code>, it
retrieves a property value that is directly related
to <code>colors</code>: the amount of elements in the array
(seven).</p>

<p>So this typical <code>while</code> loop, using
the <code>count</code> variable to track its progress, goes over the
elements of the array one by one, uses them to set the current color,
and then draws a circle of the right size.</p>

<p>Since this kind of loop is very common (create variable, test it
in <code>while</code> condition, and update it), there is a more
compact way to write it. This program is equivalent to the one
above:</p>

<pre>function rainbow(x, y) {
  var colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "cyan", "purple", "white"];
  for (var count = 0; count < colors.length; count = count + 1) {
    color(colors[count]);
    circle(x, y, 150 - 5 * count);
  }
}</pre>

<p>In a <code>for</code> loop, initializing the loop state, checking
it, and updating it, are all grouped together, to make it easier to
see that they belong together.</p>
